Cotton", "rating": ["4.0"], "TEXT": "Ragnarok is an excellent follow up to the 2018 God of War game.Positives:Excellent combat mechanics, bolstered by a new weapon half way through the game.Brilliant voice acting and animation work that gives real emotional heft to key scenes. Richard Schiff as Odin was a masterstroke of casting (especially if you're a West wing fan like me).A sense of sufficiently grand scale for the climatic set piece battles.Interesting variation amongst the different realms you explore, decent array of enemies.A strong focus on themes of family, friendship and growing up which cuts through the bigger mythological story.Faultless graphics and art direction.Negatives:Exploration can be frustrating, similar to the last game. Minor progression bugs, confusing level mechanics (night/day giving different routes, areas closing off at certain points of the story etc) lead to quite a bit of fruitless wandering around trying to find an exit.The main plot is a bit padded, and the focus on \"destiny\" is less compelling than the family drama. Some plot threads like *minor spoiler* Atreus in Jotunheim *spoiler* drag a bit.Combat is a bit spongey, especially against the bosses. A lot of attacks feel weightless especially given the impressive visuals.There are quite a few cookie cutter side quests (fetch this, kill that) that don't add much to the story.Overall a brilliant game, but it did feel padded out to make it bigger than the last one.\n  \n"},
{"USERNAME": "Henry", "rating": ["5.0"], "TEXT": "This is hands down the best game I have played in a long time, every inch of the game is a rewarding experience full of lore and dynamic characters, dialogue and world experiences. Returning to the Norse realm in a bigger than ever sequal is a thrill every step of the way, Kratos and Atreus character development is better than ever. Aside from the story this is a perfect example on how to release a game, front release date the bugs where extremely minimal and I noticed no issues except one freeze that required a reboot. Graphics are stunning and the various graphical options are refreshing too see. I personally highly recommend playing in the dynamic 4K + 60 FPS performance mode for stunning visuals, comfortable frames and great HDR. Disable HRF Mode which unlocks to 90 FPS as this mode is stuck at the PS5 limited chroma subsampling which slightly dampens the colours\n  \n"},

You start out selecting from a fair selection of accessibly options and other performance settings. Once in the game it gives you the option to catch up on what happened in the previous game which is nice to go through. You then kick off the game learning the basic movement and combat before really progressing into the fantastic game play. I have not observed any bugs or glitches in the game play so far. I did make sure to install the day one patch as recommended. First thing i really noticed is the haptic feedback on this game is amazing as are the visuals and sound effects. The combat controls are similar to the previous game and felt natural and easy to get into. Kratos himself is as gruff as ever with Christopher Judge continuing to do a great job voicing Kratos as the character develops new layers. Characters from the previous game return with the same great banter to lighten up a sometimes-heavy story. New characters have an interesting choice of voice direction but works well once you have got used to it. There are more side quests in this one and a lot of opportunities to explore to find loot for upgrading your equipment or making new equipment. The usual skill tree can be augmented if you use a skill enough times, you can unlock a rune for it to make it more powerful. Items comes with different perks so you can really customize kratos to your play style. So far, I'm very much enjoying playing Ragnarok and would absolutely recommend it to everyone.\n  \n"},

I completely lost myself in the story, I couldn't stop myself playing. The story is extremely well written, the graphics are fantastic and will definitely ruin the next few games I had my eyes on, as the attention to detail, textures and animations will be hard to top from what the next big releases on my list have previewed so far.The story has been a roller coaster of emotions and I'm glad that we also get the chance to play as other players than Kratos at times to experience a whole different timeline/side of the story. I laughed, I cried, I shouted at my TV when I got killed in a boss fight, i was shocked at some twists and turns. Everything I could ask of a game and so much more.If you, too, found Atreus incredibly annoying in the first part, there will be times where you wanna kill him and will roll your eyes, but by far not to that extent and I even took a liking to him in general (apart from some things he said and did), the character development is apparent - not only in Atreus, but also in Kratos in particular. I do hope for another part or at least a long DLC, there's some questions and loose ends that need explaining!!10/10, would recommend (if you couldn't tell).\n  \n"}
